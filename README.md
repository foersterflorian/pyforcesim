# PyForceSim
**Gym Simulation Environments for Manufacturing Systems using Salabim**

*currently in progress*

Goal: provide a flexible interface to design simulation environments for manufacturing systems which can be easily integrated in reinforcement learning workflows and provides a convenient way to conduct differing experiments

Additional information is provided at later project-stages.
